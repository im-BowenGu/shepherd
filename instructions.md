# Setting up the repositories and building the docs

## Clone the repos
1. Clone Shepherd: 
	git clone git@github.com:RoboConOxfordshire/shepherd.git

2. Init the sheep submodule:
	cd sheepsrc
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

3. 	1. Install NVM (node version manager)
	2. Using nvm install node version 8.1.0, `nvm install 8.1.0`
	3. `nvm use 8.1.0` 
		The nodejs version used now is v8.1.0, this version is from 2017, but seems to be the only version everything is compatible with.
	4. npm install
	5. npm run vuepress:build
	6. Check the errors, all I did to fix them is the following:
		sudo apt-get install imagemagick  -- install imagemagick used for the next command
		cd images
		find . -name "*.jpg" -exec mogrify -format png {} \;  -- for every jpg image create a png alternative
		cp upload-button.png upload.png
		cp run-button.png shepherd-run.png
		cp run-button.png run.png  
	7. to view it on your computer use `npm run vuepress:dev`, and it should host the docs at `http://localhost:8080/docs/` and images should work.



## To rebuild the sheep IDE:

when building the docs you might have seen the app folder within sheep this contains the ide.
First make sure that you're using the correct npm version: `nvm use 8.1.0`
Build it by running `npm run build` in the sheep/ directory. This may take several minutes, and will seem to get "stuck" at points, if it takes more than 15 minutes then something's wrong.
Then in the ../manuallybuiltsheep there should be some files
Copy these files into the ~/shepherd/blueprints/staticroutes/editor/ directory
